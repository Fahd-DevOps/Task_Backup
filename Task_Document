Title: Secure Encrypted Backup and Restore Script Design

Architecture:

The suite consists of three main components: backup.sh, restore.sh, and backup_restore_lib.sh. These scripts work together to create secure backups of specified directories, encrypt them, and later restore these backups.

Components:

backup.sh: This script handles the backup process, including directory selection, encryption, and remote copying using scp.
restore.sh: This script restores backups created by backup.sh, decrypts files, and places them in the specified restore directory.
backup_restore_lib.sh: A library of functions shared between the backup.sh and restore.sh scripts. It provides validation, backup/restore functions, and encryption handling.
Functionality:

backup.sh:

- Validates input parameters.
- Creates backup directories with timestamp.
- Loops through source directories and backups recent files within the specified days.
- Archives and encrypts directories and files.
- Copies backups to a remote server.

restore.sh:

- Validates input parameters.
- Creates a temp directory for restoration.
- Loops through backup files, decrypts and stores them in the temp directory.
- Restores files from the temp directory.

Assumptions:

- Both the source and backup directories exist.
- GnuPG and tar utilities are available.
- Secure communication is set up for remote copying.
- Encryption and decryption keys are provided as plain text.

Dependencies:

- GnuPG for encryption and decryption.
- tar for archiving and compression.
- scp for remote copying.

Security Considerations:

- Encryption keys are passed as plain text; handle key security with care.
- Ensure appropriate access controls on backup and restore directories.
